## Features
- Single Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption
- Multiple Caesar Ciphers (Polyalphabetic Cipher) encryption and decryption
- Permutation of text
- Reverse permutation of text

## Usage
1. Clone or download the script to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory where the script is located.

## Encryption
- Choose option `1` to encrypt a text file.
- Select either a single Caesar Cipher or multiple Caesar Ciphers.
- Input the key(s) for encryption.
- Specify the block size for multiple Caesar Ciphers.
- Enter the filename of the text file you want to encrypt.

## Decryption
- Choose option `2` to decrypt a text file.
- Select either a single Caesar Cipher or multiple Caesar Ciphers.
- Input the key(s) for decryption.
- Specify the block size for multiple Caesar Ciphers.
- Enter the filename of the text file you want to decrypt.

## Permutation
- Choose option `3` and then `1` to permutate a text file.
- Enter the filename of the text file you want to permutate.

## Reverse Permutation
- Choose option `3` and then `2` to reverse permutate a text file.
- Enter the filename of the text file you want to reverse permutate.

## File Output
- The encrypted or decrypted text will be saved in a file named `ciphertext` or `plaintext` respectively.
- The permutated or reverse permutated text will be saved in a file named `ciphertext` or `plaintext` respectively.

## Exiting the Program
- Choose option `4` to end the program.

**Note:** Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read and write files in the specified directory. Always provide valid inputs as per the instructions prompted by the script.
